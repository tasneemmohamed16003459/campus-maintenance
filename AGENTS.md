# AGENTS.md — Campus Maintenance

## Project
- Backend: NestJS + Mongoose in `apps/api`
- Frontend: Next.js App Router in `apps/web`
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- API docs: Swagger
- Generated types: `apps/web/lib/api-types.ts`
- Specification: `specs/campus-maintenance.md`

## Architecture
1. Preserve MVC/separation of concerns.
2. Controllers handle HTTP concerns; services handle business/database logic.
3. Schemas define persistence; DTOs validate API input.
4. Frontend must use the API, not MongoDB directly.
5. Do not add out-of-scope features without approval.

## Contract
Create fields: title, description, location, category.
Categories: equipment, electrical, plumbing, facility, other.
Statuses: open, resolved.
Client must not set status on create.

Routes:
- POST /requests
- GET /requests
- GET /requests?category=<category>
- PATCH /requests/:id/resolve

## Quality and security
- No `any` unless unavoidable and justified.
- Validate external input.
- Add/update meaningful tests.
- Do not add unnecessary packages.
- Reuse `components/ui`.
- Never expose or edit `.env`, credentials, tokens, API keys, or connection strings.

## Commands
Backend:
```bash
cd apps/api
npm run start:dev
npm test
npm run lint
```

Frontend:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
npm run lint
```

Refresh API types:
```bash
npx openapi-typescript http://localhost:3001/api-json -o apps/web/lib/api-types.ts
```

## Workflow
Plan → implement small steps → verify → read diff → log AI usage → PR → review → CI → merge.
